<H5> What Is Slime Rancher? </H5>
<p>  Slime Rancher is a first-person life simulation adventure video game.
The player controls a character named Beatrix LeBeau, a rancher who moves to a planet far from Earth called the Far Far Range 
to live the life of a "slime rancher", which consists of constructing her ranch and exploring the world of the Far Far Range 
in order to collect, raise, feed, and breed slimes.Slimes are gelatinous living organisms of various sizes and characteristics. 
To progress she has notes left by the former owner of the ranch that help her on her journey through the Far Far Range. 
The game's main economic aspect revolves around feeding slimes the appropriate food items so that they produce "plorts", 
which can then be sold in exchange for Newbucks, the games currency. Newbucks are used to purchase upgrades to the rancher's 
equipment or farm buildings. The player moves the character around a variety of environments and can collect slimes, food items, and plorts 
by sucking them up with their vacuum tool called a "Vacpack". They can only store a limited number of items and item types at a time 
and must go back to their ranch to unload their collected items before being able to collect more. The player must buy and upgrade 
various enclosures to house their collected slimes and farms for storing their food. Upgrades can also be aesthetic upgrades to the 
character's home, Vacpack, and the ranch itself.</p>
<H5> The aim of the game </H5>
<p> The aim of the game is to explore the whole of the far far range and find and farm every slime. You can do this by exploring and unlocking
doors around the map. These doors can be unlocked with keys which can be obtained by feeding Gordo slimes (massive versions of slimes found around
the map) there favourite food. The gordo will burst open, dropping some loot and a key. 
Once the door is open it will unlock a new section of the map with even more areas to explore. These new areas will have new slimes to find and capture.
Eventually, once you have completed enough of the game, you will be asked to go back to your home base. awaiting there will be a message which will 
tell the player that they are going home. This will mark the end of the storyline game and no you can rome free. </p>
