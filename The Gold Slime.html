        <p class="card-text">The most exclusive and sought after of all slime species is easily the gold slime. 
		Very little is known about these slippery creatures as they have proven impossible to capture. Gold slimes are quick as a 
		flash and will immediately begin to flee ranchers on sight. If a rancher is to profit from an encounter with a gold slime, 
		they need to think quick. Gold Slimes produce a sparkle sound effect when nearby, and have a low chance of appearing in specific 
		spots around the world. A Gold Slime on the ground (not airborne) can detect the player in its field of view from 25 units away. 
		In the event this happens, it will emit a faint "Aah!" and flee from the player, where it will despawn after a few seconds whether 
		on the ground or in mid-air, however constraining it in the vac stream will prevent it from despawning for the duration it is ensnared. 
		It cannot be stored in the Vacpack.</p>

      <h5 class="card-title">What is the Gold Slime used for?</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Shooting items at the Gold Slime will cause it to drop Gold Plorts and other resources, which can then be captured with your Vacpack. 

While this may sound simple, the hard part is trying to shoot at the Gold Slime before it flees. Gold Slimes will quickly run away when you approach them, 
so you need to act fast when you spot one in the wild. Gold Slimes and their Plorts are also extremely rare, which makes them a very valuable resource. 
These plorts go for an average of 300 newbucks each!</p>

      <h5 class="card-title">How to capture a gold slime</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Gold Slimes are one of the rarest naturally occurring Slimes in the entire game. You can’t breed them; they just show up in the wild randomly here and there. 
	  If they spot you, they’ll dash away at ludicrous speed, and if they get too far, they’ll despawn. Normally, the solution would be to catch them in your Vacpack, but due to their slippery nature, Gold Slimes can’t be kept in a Vacpack.
	  But you still want to get one of these things if possible, as they produce highly valuable Plorts. So if you can’t pull them in, the solution is to push them away. To capture one you must first find one. To do this it is importnt that you look in the areas whihc they can spawn in.
	  This include: ring island, the dry reef, ash island, the indigo quary, the ancient ruins, and the lower half of the moss blanket. Once you have found your gold slime, you have to
	  catch it in a vac stream an fling it towards your ranch. you can also hit it with other slimes to push it along. Once your slime is in your ranch you must Construct a #1 Slime Stage and place the Gold Slime on it to keep it secured. 
	  Now you can show off your gold slime to all your friends.</p>
